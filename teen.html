<p style="font-family:verdana;">According to the Verywellfamily.com site, “Social networking plays a vital role in broadening teen social connections and helping them learn valuable technical skills. But what impact is all of this social networking having on young minds?” Teens’ developing brains are extremely vulnerable to so much time online, and because they often have difficulty self-regulating their screen time, risks increase which means they are more susceptible to peer pressure, cyberbullying and sexting. The parenting site also lists the most common mental health related issues teens can experience from too much social media use, which include:

Anxiety
Depression
Low self-esteem
Sleep deprivation
Envy/Jealousy
Communication issues, or lack of socialization skills for teenagers
Sadness
Loneliness
Dependence</p>
